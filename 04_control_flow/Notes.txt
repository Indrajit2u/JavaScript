Javascript Execution Context
1. Global Execution Context
2. Function Execution Context
3. Eval Execution Context

process in two phases :
1) Memory Creation Phase / Creation Phase
Memory allocation phase
2) Execution Phase
function execution phase


Sample Code
    let val1 = 10
    let val2 = 5

    function addNum(num1, num2) {
        let total = num1 + num2
        return total
    }

    let result1 = addNum(val1, val2)
    let result2 = addNum(10, 2)

Javascript Execution phases:
1) Global Execution
    this

2) Memory Phase
    val1 > undefined
    val2 > undefined
    addnum > defination
    result1 > undefined
    result2 > undefined

3) Execution Phase
    val1 > 10
    val2 > 5
    addNum > (A)new execution context 
        new variable
        convironment
        +
        execution thred

        (A.1) Memory Phase (from function addNum)
            - val1 > undefined
            - val2 > undefined
            - total > undefined
        (A.2) Execution Context (from function addNum)
            - num1 > 10
            - num2 > 5
            - total > 15
            total return to global execution
